Bumblebee Primer:

It has lots of examples and tips to get everyone started using Bumblebee. 

Features so far:

1. Awesome logo? (changed a little bit after consulting with the co-creator)
2. Read Excel (includes reading multiple sheets)
3. Write Excel (flat list, nested list (depth 2), nested list (depth 3). For nested lists of depth 3 the sheet name input has to be a list for excel to write data to multiple sheets)
4. Style Excel (border style, text style, fill style, new BB Classes instead of strings)
5. Conditional Formatting (Cell Value, Expression, 2/3 Color Scale as well as TopBottom Percentile are working)
6. Line and Pie Charts.
